"This event honestly made me see Trump as a human for once. I felt bad for his family.

I can’t forgive him because of all of the lies, and damage he’s done. But it it sucks what happened and I don’t believe into any conspiracies. 

The silver lining is that Joe might get a break…. the news will focus less on his gaffes and how celebs want to replace him. 

Of course there are some too lazy to vote Trump fans who will turn out to vote, but politically I think it’s still a coin flip (or something close to what fivethirtyeight says it is).

In the past few weeks I’ve had several conversation with Republicans I have known for years and some for just a week or two. 

These are the topics that are changing minds:
1. Mass Deportation: Even my MAGA mom doesn’t want to see her Vietnamese hairstylist or her Chinese Oncologist deported. I could make no headway with mom for almost a decade but I have finally broken through and mom brought dad with her.
2. Retirement Benefits: My second cousin is a retired colonel and a major Republican. I showed him how Project 2025 is planning to take away his inflation adjusted benefits. He was understandably pissed.
3. Supreme Court placing the President above the law: At least some of the MAGA really don’t like that because it is clearly unconstitutional even to the 2a worshipers.

Let’s be clear these are all Republicans. A vote away from R and one more vote for D.

Maybe we start talking to our family, friends and acquaintances about what the future holds if Rs win in November?

Now that the GOP is trying to portray itself as championing the working class, the platform eschews the party’s traditional embrace of big business. But only for public consumption.


Despite all the populist virtue-signaling from the convention podium, Trump has made clear that his economic policy is for sale to the highest bidder. In a meeting with billionaire campaign donors, he reportedly promised to keep their taxes low by extending those tax cuts, some of which would otherwise expire at the end of next year. In a meeting with oil company executives, Trump asked for $1 billion in campaign donations and promised to reverse President Biden’s environmental policies, including the transition to electric vehicles.

"Hi there. My name is Trisha Calvarese, and I am OFFICIALLY the Democratic nominee running against Lauren Boebert here in Colorado's 4th congressional district.

Lauren Boebert is a national embarrassment. After Beetlejuice-gate, she packed her bags and moved across the state to my district. Her political career was about to end, and she knew it.

Now, she's brought her bonkers to eastern Colorado, but that doesn't mean she's going to cruise to victory here: Brand-new polling shows I can defeat Lauren Boebert and flip this seat blue! But only if I can raise the money needed to win...

My team has set a goal of raising another $50,000 so we can give Boebert the boot, but right now, we're still short. I'm not taking money from corporate PACs, so if I am going to win and defeat Lauren Boebert, I need grassroots donors like you to chip in to my campaign right now.

This is our last chance to put an end to Lauren Boebert's political career forever: Please, will you make a weekly donation to my campaign right now - every dollar you can afford - to help me defeat Lauren Boebert, flip this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats? go.trisha4co.com/7186

Together, we are going to finish the job and finally kick Lauren Boebert out of Congress.

Not only does every state have 50 different election legal systems they all have different filing deadlines for getting someone’s name on the ballot. A few of those state deadlines will already be passed by the time of our convention. But even if we could get those extended there is still the problem that EVERY county in every state also has ballot deadlines too that are even earlier than the state ones.

Even if we had time and resources and favorable judges and won the county and state level lawsuits then those lawsuits would get appealed all the way up the chain to the Supreme Court. Eating up all of the time. And then what? 

And the party would be in chaos between our convention and the time the voting begins in early October. Military ballots get mailed out even sooner.

some thoughts on our new reality:
- Kamala can reuse her old POTUS  ads against trump since nothing about has changed.  
- trump is a convicted felon, Kamala is an accomplished prosecuter.  
- trump already proved he's intimidated running against a woman, and NOW he will be running against a *woman of color*  
- MAGA already turned on JD Vance's Indian-American wife, so anything said about Kamela's Asian and Black heritage will only backfire on them!  
- anything trump says about Kamela's sex will backfire in those states where women's rights and abortion rights already won with Republican voters, male and female voters  
- Kamela successfully prosecuted: sham universities, business fraud, sex assault crimes, and charity fraud. **ALL CRIMES TRUMP IS DIRECTLY INDICTED FOR OR HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF**  
- all the ""Soros"" and ""Jewish space lasers"" red hatters will only alienate Jewish voters further, as they will be seen as direct attacks on the second husband's Jewish faith   
- MAGAs RW recent attacks calling Kamala the ""DEI VP""  will alientate the undecided POC electorate even furher  
- trump's abysmal handling of Covid and his catastrophic debt record will be front and center, with NOTHING to compare it to

"Andy Beshear should become Kamala Harris's VP Nominee. His background is amazing, his record of action as governor too. He has won a red state while running for governor of the great state of Kentucky, so he knows how to appeal to swing, and Trump voters. If elected, his Lieutenant Governor can take over, who is a Democrat so no need to worry.

Although many stated that Shapiro or Cooper or even Kelly would make a great pick (and they would! But Beshear would be the best) due to being from critical swing states, you have to also remember that Beshear had to win over Trump voters and swing state voters in an R+20 State in order to become Governor of Kentucky, and he would make an amazing pick. The rural voters of Kentucky love him. He may even pull over some moderates considering voting Trump but might switch due to Vance. He will seem reasonable against the MAGA Extremist
J.D Vance in the Vice Presidential Debates and will curbstomp him during the debates, and Reminder that he also won in a Republican +20 State and had to win over Trump voters in order to win.

That means that Trump could actually have 52.3%… in other words the polls don’t show that Harris is polling better than Trump, the polls show there is no statistically significant winner from the data taken.

"The National Labor Relations Board issued a final rule today reviving a tactic commonly used by unions to delay votes on dissolving bargaining units or elections they think they will lose.
 
The rule rescinds a measure adopted by appointees of Republican former President Donald Trump in 2020, which the now Democratic-led board said could interfere with the right of employees to make free, informed decisions on union representation.
 
It is the latest move by the Biden-era NLRB seen as favoring unions, after the agency last year adopted rules speeding up the union election process and created a new path for unions to organize workers outside of the longstanding secret-ballot election process.
 
The 2020 rule that the board wiped out today had barred NLRB staff from temporarily blocking elections while a related case alleging illegal labor practices was being litigated.

"barely two weeks after a supporter was shot and killed and two others critically wounded at his last outdoor rally, trump is not only outright *defying* heightened security recommendations and protocols to protect not only **him**, but also his attendees -**which includes children and seniors**- he's 'ALL CAPS' 
 **boasting** about it on his platform...

so, let's un-trump this:
  
- trump demanded the FBI tell the public that a bullet and *not shrapnel* hit his ear. why? because ""shrapnel"" doesn't sell all the merch his campaign began grifting before trump even made it from the stage to the SUV that day  
  
- indoor venues have *seat counts and capacity limits*, [which makes it harder to feign that he's still drawing ""yuge crowds""](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-brags-about-crowd-size-front-empty-seats-1842143) 
  
- the media pool placement at outdoor venues can't capture the true crowd size because they only have the cameras pointed at trump and the [craiglist-paid attendees](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-caught-paying-people-to-attend-nevada-rally/) directly behind him, as such they can't also capture the [attendees filing out in droves]( https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/donald-trump-rally-video-shows-mass-walking-out-during-speech/ar-BB1miYt8) when they get bored of the same montonous meandering drivel he's been giving them for nearly a decade  
  
- trump **knows** backing out of debating Kamala Harris [shows how terrified he is of getting dragged by a woman on a national stage](https://thehill.com/homenews/4794429-buttigieg-trump-debate-harris/); so his addled, narcissistic smooth brain thinks he can trick his low-information voters into appearing ""strong"" by defying security concerns  
  
- Corey Comperatore's **heroic** death *rightly* continues to cast a large shadow over the smaller-than-a-shaving-nick to trump's ear; so, in pure trump fashion he is using Comperatore's death as means to paint *himself* as the ""hero"" because even in death, no one should ever dare take attention away from **him** (see John McCain)  
   
- I've scoured [trump's truth social feed](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump), and he's made *less than 3 mentions* of Comperatore's death **since the day it happened**, even as trump is demanding Wray ""apologize"" to him in a [recent post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112854562463116292), he makes sure to complain about the ""J6 hostages"", but doesn't utter Comperatore's name at ALL.  
- In fact, trump hasn't made a single mention of Comperatore or the two survivors unless it's transactional benefit for him, about him and most importantly, **for him**. and yet, **demands and chants for trump to ""SAY HIS NAME!"" are curiously absent from MAGA** and the GOP at large  
    
- trump could respectfully and quietly have a private, invite-only, 'family and friends of' ceremony to honor Comperatore, but that  doesn't involve giving **him** any credit and trump would have to focus on Comperatore being highlighted as the hero, not himself.  
  


>I could shoot someone in the middle of Fith Avenue and not lose any voters!  

*a supporter getting shot and killed in the middle of an outdoor rally lost only lost him* **one** *voter*  

but, Comperatore's untimely death did something else far more tragic and devastating to trump, it dared to take attention away from **him**, it dared to make a wholly qualifed, 100% earned, bonafied hero out of Comperatore and highlight trump for the bombastic, narcissistic, grifting fraud he truly is...and he **knows it**. 

putting politics aside, just at the very basic level of human decency and respect for the dead: using Comperatore's death as a campaign fundraising vehicle *at the very same place it happened*, with complete disregard for the community and attendees who are still trying to process it, is beyond the pale (er, orange) even for trump.

",1722110063,26,democrats,:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,nothing says you care about your supporter's safety like bragging about ignoring safety protocols...,"nothing says you care about your supporter's safety like bragging about ignoring safety protocols... barely two weeks after a supporter was shot and killed and two others critically wounded at his last outdoor rally, trump is not only outright *defying* heightened security recommendations and protocols to protect not only **him**, but also his attendees -**which includes children and seniors**- he's 'ALL CAPS' 
 **boasting** about it on his platform...

so, let's un-trump this:
  
- trump demanded the FBI tell the public that a bullet and *not shrapnel* hit his ear. why? because ""shrapnel"" doesn't sell all the merch his campaign began grifting before trump even made it from the stage to the SUV that day  
  
- indoor venues have *seat counts and capacity limits*, [which makes it harder to feign that he's still drawing ""yuge crowds""](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-brags-about-crowd-size-front-empty-seats-1842143) 
  
- the media pool placement at outdoor venues can't capture the true crowd size because they only have the cameras pointed at trump and the [craiglist-paid attendees](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-caught-paying-people-to-attend-nevada-rally/) directly behind him, as such they can't also capture the [attendees filing out in droves]( https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/donald-trump-rally-video-shows-mass-walking-out-during-speech/ar-BB1miYt8) when they get bored of the same montonous meandering drivel he's been giving them for nearly a decade  
  
- trump **knows** backing out of debating Kamala Harris [shows how terrified he is of getting dragged by a woman on a national stage](https://thehill.com/homenews/4794429-buttigieg-trump-debate-harris/); so his addled, narcissistic smooth brain thinks he can trick his low-information voters into appearing ""strong"" by defying security concerns  
  
- Corey Comperatore's **heroic** death *rightly* continues to cast a large shadow over the smaller-than-a-shaving-nick to trump's ear; so, in pure trump fashion he is using Comperatore's death as means to paint *himself* as the ""hero"" because even in death, no one should ever dare take attention away from **him** (see John McCain)  
   
- I've scoured [trump's truth social feed](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump), and he's made *less than 3 mentions* of Comperatore's death **since the day it happened**, even as trump is demanding Wray ""apologize"" to him in a [recent post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112854562463116292), he makes sure to complain about the ""J6 hostages"", but doesn't utter Comperatore's name at ALL.  
- In fact, trump hasn't made a single mention of Comperatore or the two survivors unless it's transactional benefit for him, about him and most importantly, **for him**. and yet, **demands and chants for trump to ""SAY HIS NAME!"" are curiously absent from MAGA** and the GOP at large  
    
- trump could respectfully and quietly have a private, invite-only, 'family and friends of' ceremony to honor Comperatore, but that  doesn't involve giving **him** any credit and trump would have to focus on Comperatore being highlighted as the hero, not himself.

You folks have ruined the neutral spaces with your disgusting rhetoric so now many of us tend to just stay here. We are not at all insulated from your points of view that are so incredibly monolithic (impressively so -- and dangerously so, some might say). So now we tend to congregate in subs such as this.

If the founding fathers knew what you would do with their ideas, they'd have known we don't deserve the freedom they swore to protect in the Constitution.

The freedom of speech comes with the responsibility to speak well, speak productively, speak honestly. You trolls who come here fail to do so. You fail to come here with intellectual honesty, you come here to troll and try to smear us, you come to be a thorn in our side, you come thinking you alone know the truth. But you don't. If you were honest you would know that you don't know the truth. You would know that just because a lawsuit has some bombastic claims it doesn't mean they are true because you have seen it before and because you have seen the opposite: people with no claims against them who turned out to be horrible people.

Your leaders and media have lied to you for the past two years (at least) about the health of Biden, we told you the truth and you told us we were evil for it. Your leaders lied to you about the origins of Covid and the effectiveness of the vaccines. We told you the truth and you vilified us for it. Your leaders lied to you about the Hunter Biden laptop. We told you the truth but you vilified us for it. You vilified us even after the truth came out about all these things.

These are verifiable lies that YOUR OWN LEADERS told you while we were telling you the truth, and yet you vilify us still.

It is illuminating to see their hyper-pleasantness in all of reddit except when they show up here and especially in modmail. That behavior is pathetic. I'm not perfect, I will tell a person to fuck off from time to time. That's not very Christian of me, but Christianity is not about being perfect, we all fall to sin at times. That is not hypocrisy, it's the difficulty of life. But folks that behave the way I just described above are true hypocrites. You have no honor, you are mindless folks with hate in your hearts.

Repent. God loves you and so do many of us even if you make it fucking hard to do so.

Even when you come with ""facts"", and on rare occasion some of you do, is the necessary to interject when we are trying to deal with a tragedy? No, you are being shitty when you do. There is a time for harsh truths and there is a time for mourning or just processing. Not realizing that shows a serious lack of decorum that you may say is relegated only to your virtual lives, but that same vile thinking pervades your whole life. That is no way to live.

"Before I say anything, I want to explain where I come from... I grew up in the Republican home, both of my parents voted Republican.

I, along with my wife, both registered and voted Republican in 2020. for both of us, it was our first time voting, And we both voted for Donald Trump. I admit, I bought the hype... I bought the belief that Donald Trump was one of was going to win in a landslide in 2020... yet that never happened.

After watching the documentary 2000 Mules, I became utterly convinced that there was some type of election interference that occurred during that election, and it completely dissuaded me from ever voting again. Now let's fast forward to yesterday... what happened yesterday was it travesty. A nightmare. A failed attempt to take someone's life and light of how we now know that the shooter was a registered Republican I am personally convicted at the thought of sitting this out this year and not voting... after seeing what happened, the desire to vote has been rekindled, and is a fire blazing in the heart of my soul... having said that, I still wonder if it's even worth it.

I am conflicted in my heart about all of this, about the election, about republican turnout, about Election interference... I'm still wondering whether I should even go vote this November or not...  
I know Donald Trump is saying ""too big to rig"", but with how entrenched Democrats and fake Republicans are in our government there is only so much that a registered voter can do to try and prevent election interference. What is the point in voting in this upcoming election when the odds are stacked so heavily against us? I find it hard to tell myself it's going to get better, trump is going to win, because of the fiasco that we saw in 2020.

I am genuinely concerned where this nation is headed, and I don't want to see Joe Biden become president again... I don't believe for a second that this nation can survive another four years of him, let alone I don't think Joe Biden can live another 4 years seeing the state had these currently in right now physically wise...

however, we also see that the Democrat Party is quicker to remove Joe Biden and put someone else in the leadership role, such as Gavin Newsom, or Kamala Harris, or even Michelle Obama... they are willing to do anything and everything they can to usurp the Republicans foothold... I'm genuinely at odds with myself about this, and I hope I'm not the only one out there who feels like this... it's maddening, it's conflicting, it's confusing, it's I feel hopeless and defeated with this... I'm trying not to, but it's really hard not to see that Why should I believe that this election is going to be any different than the last one? The last one, allegedly we had a gigantic amount of support, yet that was a flat out lie, apparently, if you believe that the numbers are indeed accurate... I am indeed a Christian, but even as a simple human being, that doesn't mean I have fears, or anxiety over the current political situation...

I'm asking all of you:  
is any one else going through this?

"I am unironically thanking Joe Biden for his service to our country, because this election is already over and it’s time for me to become Republican again. 

I am a reflective neocon who fell out of this party 8 years ago with the election of Donald Trump. With Trump I was wrong, but it took Covid coverups and scandals for me to understand how bad things were, and looking back at Trump’s real accomplishments he gained my respect. 

But this isn’t about our once and future president, it’s about the terribly flawed one we have right now, the one I helped put into office, Joe Biden. 

Most of my experience in supporting the Democratic Party these past few years has been, galling and utterly disappointing. The moment they could no longer identify a woman I knew there was no future there, and I set about trying to find my way back to my roots, but the party I knew is gone

 I am happy now with many of the developments in this party I was skeptical of before. This Republican Party will actually shrink the the Federal Government instead of slowing it’s growth. State’s Rights to self determination will flourish once again and a new balance will be reset. America as a whole needs to take a step back from the world and regroup. 

The failure of Neocons such as myself was not that we wanted something bad, global stability is a wonderful thing, but that we wanted it too badly. We forgot the costs at home and lost sight of our purpose. 

We’ve gone through so many debacles with Biden I can’t help but be embarrassed for my vote for him on those counts, but in one thing I am very glad he stepped up. In supporting Zelenskyy he prevented Ukraine from being overrun, and avoided a security crisis in NATO. 

I know any praise for the soon to be vanquished President will give many here a case of indigestion, but in this he was the man for the hour. 

I know many in the party wish a complete withdrawal of aid, and  that should happen in time, but aid should continue so that Trump can negotiate this Peace from a position strength, not weakness. Biden, although laudable for standing up for Ukraine could not stand down because of his own feebleness.

 Only Trump can bring Peace. 

I think not only America dodged a bullet last Saturday, but the world might have too.

My prayers are with Donald Trump and the New Republican Party. 

Give us a landslide in November!

Im Irish myself but a lover of all international politics. Im 30 and have grown up in the largely liberally-dominated west. Im also a gay man. The perfect stereotype for a Left voter in many ways. My own country, Ireland, leans left on many issues and many would have a fondness for the US Democratic Party.

 However in the past few years since COVID and the intervening period since of mass migration into Europe, disastrous neoliberal policies and the growth of wokeism in social policy,  I have began to open my eyes and look at things from a more nuanced position - which I never did before. 

I have rediscovered my catholic faith, discovered value in conservative policies in ways I didnt before, and I am convinced more than ever after last weekend, that Donald Trump and the Republican Party are what is right for the USA right now and the western world going forward. We need leaders. Im still a gay man and I still lean left on some issues and I believe I always will, but I have come to my senses in many other ways and I hope someone like me could be accepted as a follower and member of your community.

"I'm seeing so much ignorance about this, which is not really the fault of the youth, it is a failure of our schools and of our older citizens to make sure we impart this understanding. It's also the left's fault because they have been pushing for ignorance on these issues. Why? That ignorance gives the left a foothold where it shouldn't because it can leverage what you don't know by offering ""solutions"" to things that aren't problems, ultimately giving the left more control. The communists did this to overthrow governments and it worked. Sowing ignorance is a powerful tool and it takes diligence to combat it. They are using our collective ignorance to fool us into bad ideas that will give them whoever is in power far too much power.

**Why are SCOTUS justices not elected?**

Because they are supposed to be free from having to make campaign promises they cannot and should not make. There are supposed to interpret the Constitution, they are supposed to use their wisdom, they are supposed to not be pressured to make a decision based on the fact that another election is coming up. 

They are also appointed as a check to their own power. By involving the Legislative branch (the law makers) and the Executive branch (those who enforce the laws and defend our nation) in the appointment of the justices neither the president or congress has all the power in the decision. It is also supposed to give us all some trust that there was relative agreement from both parties that the appointed justice would rule fairly and as unbiasedly as possible.

**Why are there no terms or upper age limits for a SCOTUS justice?**

The point was that if these are the only people serving our federal government with lifetime appointments then the shifts between parties that can happen every election cycle can't also rock the court. The court mores (stabilizes) the government so that if one party sweeps an election and thinks they can control everything the way they want, the court is there to check them.

This is good for everyone. The left hates this, but they don't recognize that anyone can become a tyrant. We can all be a tyrant and we need mechanisms to stop ourselves from becoming tyrants as well as the party we disagree with. Lifetime appointments to the court help prevent us from becoming tyrants.

So both the president and the congress have to approve an nomination to the court, and then no one can touch them for their life time. It was a check and balance and it was deliberate (though admittedly the role of the SCOTUS wasn't really decided until Marbury vs. Madison, which established judicial review).

**Well how do we deal with senility in the courts without an age limit?

First, they are not like the president or congress. We need a president to be virile and able to act in the middle of the night when an enemy attacks or when there is some other crisis. The courts do not need to act fast, they need to be wise. Young people can be wise, but wisdom tends to come with age. 

Also, a sudden departure of a justice does not jam up the country and make us vulnerable to our enemies.

If a justice becomes too old to act in their appointed capacity for whatever reason, there is a process to remove them. It is seldom used largely because it hasn't needed to be. Usually if a justice approaches such a time as Biden has, they have stepped down. But **there is a process to remove them should that need arise**. We need to be open to using it, but again, the need hasn't really arisen.

There could be room for some cognitive testing or something, but at the same time, do you trust the other party not to try and fudge the results or lie about the results to try and get what they want?

**What about term limits, wouldn't that help?**

No. First of all, how long should they be? To short and you ruin the stabilizing power of the court. Too long and you might as well make them for life. Also, will they be up for re-election or will the need to be re-appointed? Either way, you have that problem of that affecting their decisions for political expedience rather than based on the law as it is written.

I know it sounds like a reasonable thing on the surface, which is why this discussion gains so much steam from time to time, but it is not a good idea and the people doing it are trying to appeal to that superficial sort of sense it makes to fool you into a bad decision. If they try to convince of this, then they are either ignorant themselves, or more likely, they think you are ignorant and will give them more power by saying things that sound good to you.

Also, think about how that would look. If a term is ending, they would have to campaign if they can serve again, OR each party would select their nominees far in advance and campaign with them. It would effectively make a SCOTUS seat and elected seat, which leads us to the same problems I mentioned before as well as that justice being beholden to the party the campaigned with them. That is dangerous.

**What about packing the court? Should we do that when we don't get what we want out of the courts?**

First of all, ""packing the court"" means when you don't get what you want from the court, you change the law and add more justices to the court (there is no limit in the Constitution and originally there were only 5 justices). This is dangerous, this is what they do in banana republics, and as far as I am aware, only progressive liberal types have ever tried. Roosevelt tried to back the courts for all his New Deal stuff which was largely unconstitutional, but enough retired that he was able to appoint liberal judges to get what he wanted anyway. There was a threat from Obama and Biden both, but they backed off, frankly because Trump wasn't afraid to accuse them of trying to do that. It was undoubtedly on their agenda.

It should be immediately clear why packing the courts is bad. Even if it works for your side one time, years down the line when the conditions are just right to both pass an increase in justice seats AND pick the justices you want, then you could topple the government.

Packing the court is **not** the same as making a lot of appointments to the court. The left will tell you that Trump packed the courts by appointing many justices to both the Supreme Court and to lower courts. This is not true. Remember that all appointments to lower courts also require approval from legislative bodies (for the most part anyway... there are obviously local courts that are election based in many places).

"When J.D. Vance was announced as Trumps running mate, I know a lot of people said, ""who?"" As did I.  When I went to X or Twitter, that next day, the ""what was trending"" disturbed me.... J.D. Vance and Hitler.  

So, last night when I happen to be flipping channels, I caught the 98 year-old veteran speaking at the RNC who had been a WWII vet and a D-Day survivor and my mind went back to the trend on twitter the other day.  How can people compare a 39 year-old marine vet to Hitler?  

I turned to my husband and said, ""why do people continuously compare any politician to Hitler?  Do they even know the unspeakable things that the Nazi's did to other people?""    Of course, my husband  remarks, ""they don't teach that history in schools anymore due to the graphic nature of the violence.""  

This and other comments people make just justifies how uneducated we are before we speak.  If you watch news from other nations it shows how ignorant and silly we look to them.  I really wish more people would be open minded and have conversations that would be out of your comfort zone in order to expand our minds and not be so defensive.

-""Republicans are all for optics; they have no substance"" Did they forget Biden chose his VP and the first thing he said about her was talk about her race? Perhaps picking someone of merit and then acknowledging the historical component of the selection before pandering superficial reasons to pick a VP.

""Trump was low energy sleepy at the RNC"" Projecting much?

 I just cant, man. Liberals act like that are the peak to moral righteousness but turn a blind eye to Bidens racist and homophobic comments. Do they really care about racism, sexism, and gay rights? They will pick apart piece by piece out of everything. They will vilanize a solemn memorial for a lost hero, they will attack Trump for pandering on unity but wont bat an eye at Biden running on unity in 2020 and political violence having gotten worse since. They will call Trump ""hateful"" but dont care how Biden gets on stage and not only hammers Republicans but also ALL REPUBLICAN VOTERS. Is this unity? Get real. Trump 2024.

"I grew up on the poor side of poor in small town Georgia. My mother was a left leaning libertarian and my step dad who raised me, was generally a ""I hate all government"" individual. I grew up during the time of cell phones, the internet and video games. I vididly remember 9/11 when I was 8 years old. Soon after my step dad and mother divorced. I watched my mom, whom I love more than anything, take advantage of government programs. I watched her struggle with drug addiction. In the 5th grade, we had already bounced around to multiple counties in Georgia. I was 11 years old when my little brother was born. We bounced around more and more and more. And then I became an adult. I worked. My first job was a tire shop working 57 hours a week. In the flames of a democrat economy that absolutely no one wanted to spend money in. And then in 2016, my mother unexpectedly passed due to a heart attack. I, and luckily I had a absolutely amazing woman by my side, had to take in a 12 year old brother who found our mom dead on the floor one morning. I was 23. I am 30 now. This isn't a sempathy post. This isn't a post to get comments. I could care less of this gets one like or one million. I do want it to touch someone though. I get my ass up everyday and I work. At 23 years old, I had the unique experience of taking in a little brother who I absolutely adore. My now wife and I took him in into a house hold that already had two other kids. My step kids. My kids. My brother is the oldest. He's in college studying for Special Education on a wrestling scholarship and they dream is to come back to our little town to coach wrestling for our county. I have a wonderful step daughter who graduated and got accepted to college and she wants to be a journalist. As long as she reports the facts and only the facts, I see no problem. And we have a 13 year old that....well....he's....quite frankly, the definition of a 13 year destroyer. We will see. This whole post was to briefly explain my life.

It breaks my heart to see myself discarded as a racist or a bigot. It kills me to see that people don't understand that the people have control. It breaks my heart that people don't understand the 1st or the 2nd amendments. It kills me that people don't truly understand what this country is. It saddens me that we can't disagree and go have a drink with person. We can disagree and still enjoy each others company. You will never meet a more conservative person that just wants a more uniformed country than me. I want a country that doesn't care if it's Biden or Trump. Black or White. South or North. East coast or west coast. I want our republic. This country was founded on a theory. And as time passes, I'm more and more afraid that this theory will be disproved.

"I live in Washington and can't really be candid with friends or talk about this at work, so here we go. I have two things I different things I want to get off my chest- I hope Trump wins, and I hope Kamla loses.

**TRUMP YES:** Trump is freaking amazing for me and I really wish he runs the 2024 elections. He's done more for legal immigration for Indians trying to work in the US than any other president in the last decade - from stopping H1B abuse to being fairly vocal about how he intends to fix the 30+ year backlog on getting residency (see [all in podcast](https://youtu.be/blqIZGXWUpU?t=2626)). I'm by no means asking for what Canada or Australiais- a shit show where they let any and everyone in to abuse social safety nets. But- I do appreciate efforts to let folks like me who've been here since a decade be given the chance to start their own companies instead of working a 9 to 5 for half their life before they're able to pause and try starting something up of their own. Goddamn I hope he wins.

**KAMLA NO:** I really hope Kamala doesn't win. I've read her policies and stances on immigration- she wants to help folks who are here illegally, but I haven't found her saying or doing anything to help those trying to immigrate here legally who are burdened by decades old immigration systems that feel discriminatory based on nationality. You want to help folks who illegally crossed in and give them and their kids free resources despite not contributing to the economy? How about you do that after helping those who are trying to legally immigrate in and bring in, per immigrant, potentially $60k+ per person in taxes? How about trying to help those in who will actually benefit the US vs. be a goddamn drain on your resources?

========================

Longer, less emotional ramble:

I'm in the US on an H1-B right now. I completed my undergrad among the top of my class from UW Seattle, and have been working and growing in the field for 5 years (now a senior engineer). I want to take a break from work and start my own company- a process that takes several months. But- I cannot do that under an H1-B visa. I'm from India and I have to wait 30+ years for permanent residency to be able to start my own company (other countries get it in 3-6 months). My plans been to head back to India and start my own company there with all my savings. If Trump is able to achieve what he said- that being getting folks who graduated from a US college permanent residency early on in his second term- I'm sold. I'd love to continue working in the US itself- I love the work ethic of folks here, and while India is great- nothing matches the talent pool, conferences, and level of access you have from within the US itself.

Trump has historically been amazing for legal immigration- he cracked down on companies like TCS flooding the job market with hundreds of applicants for the same person. This person would be employed at a low cost, and be outsourced within the US to other companies, while TCS would skim the difference. Under his presidency- he enforced one application per person, and that if you're hiring somebody on this visa- they must be working directly for you. He cracked down on a lot of abuse of this system- and made it easier for folks like me to get a hold of this visa and work here in the US. I do have concerns about the dems blocking his proposed idea, or it being included with irrelevant amendments and getting blocked- but am faithful in Trump being re-elected and enacting policies to benefit legal immigration into the US.

Now that im a conservative it feels so good not to have so much hate built up inside, to be able to drive around my city (in texas) and not feel angered by the trump signs. It feels so good to not be so afraid of what trump will do if he wins because i know now what the truth is.

"Dear Mr. Trump, I hope you or a member of your staff reads this as I have a story to tell, not my story but of a great American. I am a 2 time voter excited for round 3 here. But this isn’t about you as president or politics or business. Thank you for all you’ve done for America in all those areas. This message is for my Grandpa, a great and free man, who grew up poor working in the steel yard. In early adulthood he played professional baseball as a pitcher, he then was drafted into WWII and served in the European theatre leading up to VE Day and stayed after to help with reparations. As he was helping to rebuild europe after the worst war our world has ever and hopefully will ever see, he focused on sports as he was an athlete. He helped create the German professional basketball league and played in it as a player/coach for many years. When his tour in europe was finished and it was finally time to return home to the country he loved he did not return to play baseball but to enjoy the country he just fought to safeguard its liberties. He met an incredible, who might I say was then and still is today a beautiful and kind woman, truly a diamond in the rough. My grandfather was the most incredible man I ever met and she felt the same way. After living in several states they eventually moved to a small town with their 3 amazing girls. Where they decided to stake their ground and grow roots. My grandfather started a small business that was passed on to his daughter, who with her husband operated it for years until they eventually sold to a larger company for a profit while securing their employees jobs. My grandfather loved golf more than most things, family, god, and Busch were his top 3. He played as much as he could and as long as he could. He was the man who taught me to play golf and he always called me partner. He was a bigger guy standing over 6’4 every bit of 220 lbs, a man I wouldn’t have wanted to mess with when he was 70 let alone when he was 20. I am 99% positive Hitler saw a picture of him coming across the great Atlantic Ocean and said no more, that American is too tough. My grandfather passed away a few years back, he lived the American dream. To cut to the chase watching you play golf with Bryson in the under 50 challenge reminded me of him on the course. Your swing, your stance, your confidence, your demeanor, your attitude. If I squinted my eyes it felt as if I was watching him again. Thank you for that, Mr. Trump. Now I understand my childhood hero was not perfect, he struggled with alcohol, with temptation, and was a sinner just like you and I. But that is why I believe in you. We are not a sum of all of our bad decisions and choices we make, but of who we choose to be everyday. We are what we stand up for and the people we stand for. We are all in America Americans and we choose everyday to live our lives in hate or in love. I love you Mr. Trump just as I love Joe Biden and I loved my grandfather, because we are all Americans and we cannot allow hate to enter our hearts, lest we forget the men and women who came before. One of my favorite quotes, “I  killed my brother with malice in my heart… hatred destroyed my family” I do come here with one tall order, one serious ask, one favor from one American to another. Win, and when you do restore our great country to the land of opportunity my grandfather lived in. A land where a poor steel yard worker can without a college degree, play professional sports, serve his country, own a home, afford to raise a beautiful family and run a successful business, but most importantly live a life without fear and fully free to chase the American Dream. Restore my generations hope that we can build a life that will leave our children better than when we were handed it. Restore our country so my future children can dream, so they can be fearless, so they can love their fellow man regardless of political, sexual, religious, or racial orientations. Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, poor, rich, Republican, Democrat, gay, straight, we are all American, and I think it is high time we start to all respect each other as Americans. One nation under God, indivisible. Don’t do it just for me and our fellow Americans, do it for those that came before us, for all the men and women who fought and those that died for us all. I believe in this country, my grandfather believed in this country. Thank you and god bless you Mr. Trump. 

**Names/locations altered or omitted to safeguard my family from political and nonpolitical persecution and solicitation. ",1721792640,21,Republican,,Dear Mr. Trump,"Dear Mr. Trump Dear Mr. Trump, I hope you or a member of your staff reads this as I have a story to tell, not my story but of a great American. I am a 2 time voter excited for round 3 here. But this isn’t about you as president or politics or business. Thank you for all you’ve done for America in all those areas. This message is for my Grandpa, a great and free man, who grew up poor working in the steel yard. In early adulthood he played professional baseball as a pitcher, he then was drafted into WWII and served in the European theatre leading up to VE Day and stayed after to help with reparations. As he was helping to rebuild europe after the worst war our world has ever and hopefully will ever see, he focused on sports as he was an athlete. He helped create the German professional basketball league and played in it as a player/coach for many years. When his tour in europe was finished and it was finally time to return home to the country he loved he did not return to play baseball but to enjoy the country he just fought to safeguard its liberties. He met an incredible, who might I say was then and still is today a beautiful and kind woman, truly a diamond in the rough. My grandfather was the most incredible man I ever met and she felt the same way. After living in several states they eventually moved to a small town with their 3 amazing girls. Where they decided to stake their ground and grow roots. My grandfather started a small business that was passed on to his daughter, who with her husband operated it for years until they eventually sold to a larger company for a profit while securing their employees jobs. My grandfather loved golf more than most things, family, god, and Busch were his top 3. He played as much as he could and as long as he could. He was the man who taught me to play golf and he always called me partner. He was a bigger guy standing over 6’4 every bit of 220 lbs, a man I wouldn’t have wanted to mess with when he was 70 let alone when he was 20. I am 99% positive Hitler saw a picture of him coming across the great Atlantic Ocean and said no more, that American is too tough. My grandfather passed away a few years back, he lived the American dream. To cut to the chase watching you play golf with Bryson in the under 50 challenge reminded me of him on the course. Your swing, your stance, your confidence, your demeanor, your attitude. If I squinted my eyes it felt as if I was watching him again. Thank you for that, Mr. Trump. Now I understand my childhood hero was not perfect, he struggled with alcohol, with temptation, and was a sinner just like you and I. But that is why I believe in you. We are not a sum of all of our bad decisions and choices we make, but of who we choose to be everyday. We are what we stand up for and the people we stand for. We are all in America Americans and we choose everyday to live our lives in hate or in love. I love you Mr. Trump just as I love Joe Biden and I loved my grandfather, because we are all Americans and we cannot allow hate to enter our hearts, lest we forget the men and women who came before. One of my favorite quotes, “I  killed my brother with malice in my heart… hatred destroyed my family” I do come here with one tall order, one serious ask, one favor from one American to another.

"Hi everyone,

I’ve been here a little bit in the past but just wanted to say I am proud to say I am voting Trump this November. 

I decided this about a month or so ago. I’ve usually voted 3rd party/libertarian candidates in the past, I voted Jo Jorgensen in 2020 and realized that this is not doing me or our country any good. As much as RFK Jr could be a good candidate he’s not going to win more than likely. 

I grew up in the south, have lived in liberal cities, lived in red states and blue states, currently live in a liberal city. I’ve noticed that Biden/Harris don’t care about helping build up lower income communities and instead it’s all about hand outs, it’s not about building them up as people, giving them places to work, job skills, and helping get people on their feet. It’s about keeping them down so they rely on them and will vote for them every election cycle, but the kicker is every 3/3.5 years is when democrats rediscover these communities and pander to them. I’m sick and tired of seeing it as someone who lives near these communities. I want to see these people grow and flourish and make something of themselves, but instead I see the people who are actually getting legit help from the government are not even legal citizens here as we saw in Chicago/New York/Texas/California.

I’m tired of the democrats only caring about people specifically every election cycle and getting hardly anything done in between. 

In terms of Trump, while he’s not my favorite person, I think he’s better than Kamala Harris. I feel that his policies will help the population far more than Kamala Harris.

With Trumps legal history that we all know about, I think the justice system is highly against him for political reasons, I think he’s a manufactured felon and not an actual felon, I think Alvin Bragg and the DOJ took a weird misdemeanor and bumped it up to 34 felony counts. This is the same DA in NYC who’s taken violent felons and lowered them to misdemeanors. I believe he is being weaponized and it’s all to keep him out of office and I can see right through that and I hope you all can as well.

Joe Biden has taken classified information and been given a slap on the wrist, Hillary Clinton destroyed evidence and was given a slap on the wrist. I think Trump can be given a slap on the wrist and given a pass like the other 2.

I also don’t believe the whole project 2025 narrative they’re trying to create, this is a foundation that’s been trying to push a hard right agenda for decades and they’ve never been successful and they’re not going to be successful with Trump now. Pay attention to his offical agenda, Agenda47.

When there was the assassination attempt, I saw Trump put his fist in the air and tell people to fight for what they believe in, and I think we should fight for a better America for all Americans.

At the end of the day, I do not want a SF progressive as a president. I think Trump will be better at keeping us safe, helping our economy grow, bringing higher wages back to our workers in this country, and helping get the US back to where it belongs. He’ll be better for all groups of people and help everyone grow consistently. I think Trumps strong stances are what we need for the country and that’s a strong border, strong economy, ending wars overseas and negotiating peace deals. I believe he will win but keep spreading the word. 


Btw, my family all live in a very competitive swing state and I am making sure they vote Trump as well. 

Thank you all for reading.

"After two weeks since Biden’s disastrous debate, the dust is starting to settle. As of now, Biden remains committed to stay in the race and has set the bar that he will drop out if the polls say there is no way he can win.  This comment led to many individual claiming that Biden is being sheltered from the truth or that this is a bar that can never be met.

My first question is: Do the polls say that Biden cannot win or is it possible for Biden to still win the election?

If it is still possible for Biden to win this election, how?  Where is Biden’s path to winning this election?  What does Biden and his campaign need to do or change?  

According to 538, before the debate Biden and Trump were tied nationally.  Since then, Trump has pulled ahead by 2 points.  The situation in the swing states is worse which had Biden behind before and has shifted towards Trump since.  

Despite this, 538 still considers the election a toss up.  This is due to many assumptions, most of which is that undecided voters will come home to the incumbent.  Yet, this is far from a typical election.  Trump himself is also somewhat of an incumbent and Biden has disapproval numbers that back Carter and George H W Bush.  No president has come back in history from being this far behind.

What would Biden need to do?  Press conferences and interviews constantly?  No more senior moments?  Shift his message to be less of a referendum on his presidency and more of a “here’s what we will do in term 2”? And ultimately, despite whether there is a clear path or not, can Biden even do it?  He’s struggled to maintain a hard campaign schedule and he is quite prone to public slip ups.

"In the wake of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life, there has been a decided attempt toward if not unity, then toning down the extreme rhetoric directed against your political opponent. Since Trump is the victim of a gunman whose motives, while not clear at this moment, was to kill him and thus upend the GOP nomination, Republicans can credibly claim to have the moral high ground at least for the foreseeable future.

What this might mean in practice is that any attempt on the part of Biden or Democrats to resume using extremist language against Trump like calling him a dictator, authoritarian or a proto-Hitler may backfire with the public and make him sympathetic as the victim of the shooting. Trump and his allies can claim that uttering such inflammatory rhetoric almost got him killed and any further such accusations may trigger another assassination attempt.

So, how should Biden and Democrats proceed during the final few months of the presidential campaign if one of their strongest attacks against Trump is no longer possible or would backfire against them? Should they just stick to policy arguments and tout Biden's economic record? Would Democrats try to police their own side if some of them still use such attacks against Trump?

Edit: I’m not talking about whether to restrict free speech or not. I’m asking how one should react to threatening speech"

"Post assassination attempt, with calls to turn down the political temperature, I’m wondering what the democrats could do to heed the spirit of that call while finding a strategy to overcome Trump’s lead.

It occurred to me that perhaps the strategy the French took to stave off the far right could be emulated by putting a moderate republican at the top of the ticket.  Republicans that liberals consider genuinely moderate seems like a very short list these days, but Murkowski was probably the best example I could think of off the top of my head. 

Assuming Murkowski, and the democratic powers that be would all be willing. (A very big assumption) Would that feel like an acceptable compromise to defeat Trump and keep his authoritarian tendencies at bay?

Or would it feel like selling out liberal and progressive goals yet again to maintain the corporate centric status quo?

"The 1960s were a period of societal and cultural upheaval. Political violence (including assassinations) was unfortunately a lot more common.

These are some of the high-profile assassinations.

1963: President John F. Kennedy (Democrat), assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald.  
Oswald had communist ties, but his motive is not known.

1965: Malcolm X (Black Nationalist), assassinated by Thomas Hagan.  
Thomas Hagan was involved in Black Nationalism and the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X had, by the time of his assassination, distanced himself from, and at times, condemned the Nation of Islam.

1968: Martin Luther King Jr. (Civil Rights Activist), assassinated by James Earl Ray.  
James Earl Ray's motives aren't entirely known, but some of his acquaintances (including his lawyer) had ties to White Supremacy, and strongly suspected to be racially motivated.

1968: Robert F. Kennedy Sr. (Democrat), assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan.  
Sirhan Sirhan claimed that he assassinated RFK because he was upset about RFK's support of Israel. Sirhan Sirhan himself was a Jerusalem-born Palestinian, and Jordanian citizen who supported Palestine.

Beyond political assassinations, you had lots of political violence, and violence by Police and the National Guard against Civil Rights activists and Anti-War activists.

"More specifically the primary election although technically the general election could also be done independently. A good number of lieutenant governors are not actually chosen on the coattails of their governor, some have quite a number of other independent roles, many have at least a separate primary vote. Only 19 have a system where the governor basically picks the lieutenant governor. Six have a different primary but joint ticket, and 17 have a completely separate election.

I am assuming whatever method is used to elect the president, the same rules of the electoral college, also apply to the vice president in this case except for a weird quirk that the senate chooses the VP if the electoral college has no majority (probably done originally given that the VP is the chairperson of the Senate in fact, and the Senate has in fact done this once in 1837). Or if the electoral college is repealed and replaced with something then that also applies to the VP.

Perhaps it might give some interesting legitimacy to the VP in case there is a need for a 25th amendment case or if impeachment is desired (and which also makes the fact that the chief justice is the chairperson of a Senate trial for presidents highly important). I wonder what might have happened in the 1990s if the Republicans had just given the Democrats and Gore assurances that Gore and most of the Clinton Admin could stay and get support if they agreed to go along with the impeachment. And it might also have the effect of piercing the echo chamber that a president can find themselves in at times, at least one voice who does not have to fear being sacked.",1721052174,0,PoliticalDiscussion,US Politics,What do you think of the pros and cons of a separate election held for the vice president?,"What do you think of the pros and cons of a separate election held for the vice president?

On the flipside, Virginia Republican Senate Candidate Hung Cao, who has both an immigrant and military background, trails Democratic Senator Tim Caine by a blowout 17 points, 53% to 36%.  I would think both attributes above would help Mr Cao (who also lost a house race), but apparently not.

"Not the policies they adopt, like what laws on environmental policy they adopt, but the framework on which everyone is operating.

Rule One: All elections have a non partisan jungle primary in June, followed by a general election in November where the two candidates with the greatest number of votes in June proceed to, and each voter has one vote in the primary and the general election, and the candidate with the greatest number of votes in November wins outright. Every candidate in the primary may choose to state what party they prefer. The parties however may hold their own independent endorsement votes with their own resources, like how the Democrats hold a convention vote (or central committee vote) to side with one candidate over another. In the decision as to how to choose judges, local officials, and a few other posts, it is not however allowed to be partisan and the ballots will not declare who is affiliated with what party. Local officials too have a runoff ballot with a non partisan jungle primary.

Rule Two: The legislature has districts with one member in each district. Half of the Senators are elected for 4 year terms every 2 years, the other half two years later, and the state lower house is elected every two years too. I imagine that if the federal Senate is like this then they change from 6 to 4 year terms and all of the states pick one of their two senators every 2 years rather than two thirds of the states electing one of their senators every 2 years.

Rule Three: Every legislative district is drawn by a neutral and independent redistricting commission with rules related to precluding them from being tied to partisan interests or being legislators themselves. They try to have two lower house districts in every senate district although this wouldn't apply to the federal senate, just to the other state legislatures.

Rule Four: You may hold an executive office for two terms of four years. You may hold a legislative office at the same level of government for up to 12 years (both houses are cumulatively added to this sum).

Rule Five: You may be recalled on demand of a petition. You need 12.5% of the votes cast for the executive to recall an executive officer, 20% of the votes cast for the legislator in a legislative position. If a majority votes against them, they are recalled and the vacancy is filled with a special election.

Also, know that trial court judges and prosecutors are chosen for six year terms with non partisan elections at the local level. Appeals court and supreme court judges are chosen for 12 year terms by the governor on nomination of an independent commission and the people retain them within a year of appointment for the full length of the term. I don't know if the model needs to involve changing the judiciary, but if you wish to consider the implications of changing the judiciary like this then this is what the rules are in such cases.

If you wish to consider the potential effects of direct participation in legislation, then know that an amendment to the constitution is proposed by 8% of those who voted in the last executive election or by 2/3 of each house of the legislature and a piece of legislation is proposed by 5% of those who voted in the last executive election or by a majority of both houses of the state legislature, and in each case is approved by the people with more than half of the valid votes. I am assuming that in a federal system then something like Switzerland or Australia would be used to amend the constitution with a double majority by states and the population would be necessary where that is indeed the rule in both federations. If the legislature has passed a bill, then if 5% of those who voted for the executive in the last election sign a petition within 90 days of the end of the session the bill was passed ask for a public vote on the bill, then the bill goes to the people for a decision too. These percentages apply to calculating the minimum number of votes, they don't actually have to be the very people who voted for a thing or person. This is also an optional part of considering what changes are done, but it is interesting to know.

Most of the rest of the rules are pretty similar in nature, a veto from the executive is overridden by two thirds of both houses, each house passes a bill by a majority in both houses, etc. Right now though, California is just one place and just one experiment with one defined system of parties and norms. What a federation does with these rules applicable over the whole in such a myriad of contexts would be interesting to see. Some people might have different opinions about the wisdom of some elements but the eventual outcomes and the direction of the country would be different.",1721125281,24,PoliticalDiscussion,US Politics,California has an interesting superstructure on which to base government.

"On Monday, July 15, Sean O'Brien became the first Teamsters President to address the Republican National Convention. He did not endorse Donald Trump for President, though he praised his strength in relation to the recent assassination attempt. He also offered praise for specific Republican officials who in his view have supported unions (Josh Hawley in particular). At the same time, he called out anti-union politicians and groups within the Republican coalition, including the Chamber of Commerce, and he referred to corporate union busting as ""economic terrorism.""

The Republican Party has historically been extremely hostile to unions, from opposing New Deal-era pro-worker policy to Reagan's breaking the air traffic controller strike to Republican-led state passing ""right to work"" laws. While union members are more likely to vote Republican than they used to be, unionized workers still lean Democratic and union leadership overwhelmingly supports Democratic candidates.

Additionally, he suffered life threatening injuries and spent 12 days in the ICU.

Reagan handled the whole ordeal in a humorous, nonchalant-like fashion, which left a lasting impression on voters. In the weeks and months following his assassination attempt, his image and popularity significantly increased in the polls, similar to a rally ‘round the flag effect.

Similarly, Trump raised his fist in a defiant manner and yelled, “Fight! Fight! Fight” to the crowd, which responded with cheers and affirming chants of “USA! USA! USA!.”

"Up front: I am \*well\* aware this is **wildly** implausible, both because the EU nations have zero interest in losing their individuality as components of the US, and that the politicians in the US would flip out to suddenly be outnumbered in 'their' country. This is purely a thought experiment

  
Putting aside all the reasons this will never, **ever** happen: 

  
There are currently 27 nations in the European Union. with a population of 450 million

If each nation applied as a ""state"", there would suddenly be 77 United States, with a population of 783 million



There's nothing in the Constitution that mandates political parties, so presumably the EU nations wouldn't be sending ""Democratic"" or ""Republican"" Senators to the Senate. It would be interested to see who the Senate Majority Leader would be

This is purely a thought experiment

  
Putting aside all the reasons this will never, **ever** happen: 

  
There are currently 27 nations in the European Union. with a population of 450 million

If each nation applied as a ""state"", there would suddenly be 77 United States, with a population of 783 million



There's nothing in the Constitution that mandates political parties, so presumably the EU nations wouldn't be sending ""Democratic"" or ""Republican"" Senators to the Senate. It would be interested to see who the Senate Majority Leader would be

These are the Gallup numbers for Voter Enthusiams Advantage (VEA) at the end of October of every election since 2000. The only correlation is that enthusiasm ALWAYS favors the challenger. But it doesn't translate into votes.

In 2020 Dems had an 9% advantage and won by 4.5%

**In 2016 Republicans had a 3% advantage and lost the popular vote by 2.1%**

**In 2012 Republicans had a 12% enthusiasm advantage and lost by 4%**

In 2008 Democrats had an advantage of 15% and won by 7.3%  *(if you think that Trump will have a bigger VEA than fucking OBAMA did in 2008 you're out of your fucking minds)*

**In 2004 Dems had a 2% advantage and lost the popular vote by 2.4%**

**In 2000 Republicans had a 10% VEA and lost by .5%**

So in only 4 of the last 6 elections did the party with the VEA win. And I know the election isn't decided by the popular vote.

"As a European observer, I am intrigued by the slogan “Make America Great Again” and am keen to hear from Americans about which decade they feel is being referenced when they hear these words. It is often noted in discussions about foreign policy that members of MAGA or the Republican party assert that the country needs to “fix itself first.” However, a follow-up question is rarely posed, or the conversation is often redirected at this point.

My inquiry is based on the premise that the slogan “Make America Great Again” implies a reference to a specific period when America was perceived to be great in the hearts of the people and suggests that something is currently amiss. This notion of greatness is, of course, highly subjective and can vary significantly depending on one’s demographic and generational perspective. 

Which era do you believe encapsulates this greatness, and what specific aspects of that time contribute to this perception? Additionally, how do these aspects compare to the present day, and what changes do you think are necessary to restore or even surpass that greatness?

The “Make America Great Again” slogan is undoubtedly powerful, as it resonates deeply on an emotional level. However, for a European understanding the underlying sentiments and historical references can provide a more nuanced perspective on what this slogan truly represents for different individuals. Also, the US socioeconomic indicators are generally positive despite decade-long ongoing challenges, while increased living costs seem to be a global problem.

"It seems that the conventional wisdom of Democrats benefiting from higher voter turnout might be shifting. According to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/upshot/election-democrats-republicans-turnout-trump.html), Biden leads among regular primary and midterm voters, but trails among the rest of the electorate.

This suggests an unusual dynamic where Trump, not Biden, would stand to gain if everyone in the country turned out and voted. This is a significant departure from the Obama era, where Democrats’ electoral fortunes seemed to hinge on drawing young and nonwhite voters to the voting booth.

Many of the disengaged voters who are currently leaning towards Trump are not necessarily his supporters. They are motivated by pocketbook issues, desire fundamental changes to the political system, and are far less concerned about democracy as an issue in the election. Interestingly, a portion of these voters are registered as Democrats and still identify as Democratic-leaning voters.

Their attitudes are more complicated than those of Democratic primary voters. They are much more likely to say the economy is “poor” than Democratic primary voters, and they’re much likelier to disapprove of Biden’s job performance. And many of them want fundamental changes to America, not merely a promised return to normalcy.

As we approach the election, it isn't clear whether these voters lack concern for democracy, or are more concerned by nonideological issues, like the economy and Biden’s age.

This raises the question:

Would Biden actually benefit from lower turnout in the upcoming election? Could a strategy focused on mobilizing regular primary and midterm voters, rather than trying to engage the disengaged, be more advantageous for him?

\* Concerns about Biden's age have existed since before he was elected

\* The Republican Party has been using concerns about his age as an attack for years

\* Many Democrats have expressed concerns about Biden's age, but no credible alternative chose to run in the Primary, presumably because they understood they would likely lose

\* Concerns about Biden's age have skyrocketed since the debate

\* Many Democrats are openly calling for him to step back from his plan to run for another term

Putting aside the \*wisdom\* of calling for Biden to not run, the Democratic Party isn't beholden to Biden the way that the Republicans are to Trump

  
Is that ultimately a sign of a more healthy political party, even if it complicates their attempts to win the White House?"

"I saw this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeSEx7veNKI) on ""Why no country in the world is a democracy"" (which bases a lot of its arguments on an analysis of the [Federalist Papers](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text)) and in there, there was an illustration that intrigued me a lot; an illustration that depicts our system of government as practically and ultimately having only one man in control of everything: the president; based on which it concludes that the system is mostly an autocracy.

I know that the U.S. does better than most countries in terms of its systems of checks and balances of power; the Founding Fathers were careful to really tighten that up as late [supreme court justice Antonin Scalia also argues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Justice_Antonin_Scalia_on_Separation_of_Powers_and_Checks_and_Balances.webm).

The initial video's author however argues, having reached out for further explanation, that the illusion of separation of powers is self-evident (beyond the arguments already made in the first video), in that presidents would not be campaigning about what radical and divisive policies they would pursue once they get hold of power, if they didn't know that the system grants them ultimate and nigh-unfettered powers to do what they choose and steer the country in the direction they please; granted which the people would subsequently have little control over; hence the tension we tend to have around elections (including the threats of violence and even the risk of civil war); because it creates a winner-take-all situation; an election of the next king.

The recent Roe v. Wade case also came to mind. It has been argued that the justices that overturned the case were Trump-appointed. Trump has voiced support for the decision. Democrats have now lamented that the Supreme Court is more conservative inclined, and some (like AOC) are seeking an impeachment of its justices. So again, these highlight the fact that ultimately a party in power (or it's leader), if they wanted, could pretty much alone control the direction of the state and all arms of government.

Recent talk about ""the threat to democracy,"" which is now placed in just about any sentence, also seems to lend credence to this suggestion that the system is, by design, autocratic; to wit the exploitation or otherwise of such autocratic powers is mostly at the discretion of the leader we choose; hence suggesting (that we are in fact saying) the integrity or ""design"" of the system rests on who uses it. Here, an analogy was thus given: it's almost like saying ""this bank is secure, but don't bring a thief into it, otherwise it would compromise the security;"" was the bank then secure?

What am I missing here? Because I feel like I might be missing something. Are there any better arguments that defeat or directly counter the above notions? Is the doctrine of separation of powers as employed in our system real or does it serve its purpose? Does it, and how so, sustain democracy as argued by the late Justice Scalia for example?",1721374658,19,PoliticalDiscussion,Political Theory,"Is there really separation of powers (and how effective is it), if our system creates competition for power between two parties, after which the winning party is likely to control both the presidency and congress, and sometimes even the judiciary?","Is there really separation of powers (and how effective is it), if our system creates competition for power between two parties, after which the winning party is likely to control both the presidency and congress, and sometimes even the judiciary?

"A political action committee is a PAC. There are superpacs as well, all kinds of groups that are more Byzantine than the actual Eastern Roman Empire.

* Donald Trump's shooting is now going to make him even more likely to win because of sympathy votes
* Elon Musk now openly endorses Donald Trump and donated 45 billion to his campaign

"In US government, the **Traditional Presidential Sweet 16** is a political unicorn where an individual serves two full terms as Vice-President and then two full terms as President of the United States, since the inception of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution in 1951.

The first person eligible for a Traditional Presidential Sweet 16 was **Richard Nixon**, having served two full terms as Vice-President under Eisenhower, and having then been elected to serve as President in both 1968 and 1972.  However, due to the Watergate Scandal, he resigned in 1974 before completing his second presidential term.

The second person eligible for a Traditional Presidential Sweet 16 is **Joe Biden**, having served two full terms as Vice-President under Obama, and currently running to be re-elected to his second term as President.  Achieving this is likely a key motivator keeping Biden in the race.  However, due his recent public displays of early-onset dementia, it is unlikely he will either be elected for a second term or, if he is elected, be able to complete it.

This leaves **Donald Trump**.  If he wins the 2024 election, he will be the first person eligible for a non-traditional **Reverse Presidential Sweet 16**, where an individual serves two full terms as President and then two full terms as Vice-President of the United States, since the inception of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution in 1951.  The most likely scenario for this would be with Trump winning the presidential race in 2024, and then running as Vice-President to JD Vance in 2028 and 2032.

Trump could also pursue a more obscure form of this accolade - the **Royal Presidential Sweet 16** - where the President Elect would resign immediately upon being sworn in, followed by the Vice-President’s immediate succession, and swearing in, to the Office of President.  The 22nd Amendment only prevents election to the Presidency, but there are no term limits on the Vice-Presidency or how many times an individual can succeed to the Office Of The President from the Office Of The Vice-President.  In theory, Trump could occupy the Presidency indefinitely, without amending The Constitution, as long as he could find enough straw-dogs to act as Presidential front-persons during subsequent elections.

While none of these scenarios are currently unlikely, the recent seismic shifts in political predictability make any possibility worth noting.",1721474540,0,PoliticalDiscussion,US Elections,The Presidential Sweet 16: Trump or Biden?,"The Presidential Sweet 16: Trump or Biden?

I feel like not enough people are talking about this. This election is looking close. There’s a real possibility that Joe Biden could win with 270 EV’s to 268 EV’s for Trump. In this scenario Biden wins WI, MI & PA, while Trump wins NV, AZ and GA. 

In the 2020 census, red states were undercounted, while blue states were overcounted - granting up to 7 more electoral college votes to democrat states. 

Given the aftermath of the 2020 elections, is America prepared for this scenario?

"The main argument being presented is that Justice Sotomayor, due to her age and health issues such as Type 2 diabetes, should consider retiring. There is concern that if her health prevents her from fulfilling her duties, the Democrats could face a potential 7-2 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Advocates for her retirement argue that now is an opportune time for the Democrats to appoint a younger, healthier Justice. Missing this chance could mean waiting another four years if Trump is reelected, or possibly eight years if the Republicans secure another victory in 2028.

My question is about the feasibility of such a scenario. Do the Democrats have sufficient time and the necessary voting power to facilitate a smooth transition to a new Supreme Court member?

"In recent political debates, former President Donald Trump has been criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris, particularly focusing on her laughter. This raises several questions about the role of personal traits in political discourse.

In recent political debates, former President Donald Trump has been criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris, particularly focusing on her laughter.

"One of the biggest worries that started popping up on Sunday was that the country isn’t ready for a woman president yet. It makes sense, especially with Kamala as she didn’t have the best reputation amongst Democrats to begin with coming out of the last election. That being said, in 24 hours she broke fundraising records and has near unanimous support across the party.

Looking back at the political landscape at the start of the election season, I feel that she would have come in to the race with the same baggage as 2020. That includes the “country isn’t ready” concern, and it would have been an uphill climb to overcome.

Fast forward to today, the country had been reluctantly behind Biden. When he dropped out of the race, there was a palpable wave of energy that took the party by storm. People had hope, were inspired, and were excited at the possibilities of what comes next. Kamala entering the race right as this surge of enthusiasm picked up allowed people to look past the hypothetical concerns that plagued her before. Instead of wondering how America would react to a woman president, they were looking into why Democrats seemed to be so excited about her as a candidate. They went into their research with open eyes and a positive attitude, and came out as full blown supporters.

That’s the root of my question / discussion. We tend to look at Biden holding on to the nomination for as long as he did as damaging, as it left his replacement with only a few months to effectively campaign. But as we look back at that decision in years to come, will it ultimately be seen a good or a bad one?

"With the nomination of Kamala Harris looming, it seems like Biden stepping down as energized voters who were otherwise on the fence about participating in the election. There is a lot of infighting in the left right now regarding the DNC’s stance on Palestine and Gaza. Critics of Joe Biden lament that he did not come down on Israel harder, and claim that a Harris presidency won’t yield better results for Gaza. 

However, there has been a bit of a backlash against the backlash so to speak. Many liberal voters seem to be disengaging from the Palestinian conflict to focus on domestic issues, such as securing abortion and LGBT rights. Frustration against pro-Palestinian voters seems to be a bit more common as they fail to find a compromise. 

Does this spell the end of the massive Free Palestine movement on the left? For almost a year now, this movement has dominated the space, with massive student protests and public demonstrations. But with the election on the horizon, are we seeing a divestment from overseas issues? 

Where do you see the free Palestine movement shifting towards in the future? It seems like most activists are screaming into the void at this point, and many have since lost hope of their being a solution and shifting attention on other issues. Will Palestine be a major determining factor in this upcoming election?

"(The details of Trump's withdrawal aren't important but imagine he bumped his head or similarly came down with a bad case of covid and could no longer sustain a bid for the presidency nor lead his party).

In the past week, we've been on a media tour of top democrats and why they should be considered for a leadership role: Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Josh Shapiro, Mark Kelly, Gretchen Whitmer, Andy Beshear, and a few more I can't think of right now. Each candidate has a robust resume of winning in their own state and impressive personal histories abound. 

Then, when it came down to the wire and Kamala was the only obvious choice, Democrat leadership rallied within days to express support from every corner of the party. There was no real infighting made apparent to the public. After a lifetime of losing faith in spineless and selfish elected representatives, I've been kinda shocked by such unity in the face of an emergency.

Now, if basically the same exact thing happened to Donald Trump, no matter how likely or unlikely: 

-Would there be any support for Vance to automatically get the nod? 

-Which leaders in the Republican party would stand out as potential replacement nominees? How would right-wing voters prioritize a replacement?

"In the Constitution, as peoply may vaguely remember, the electoral college only elects a president by itself if a majority of electors support the person elected. Also, it doesn't address the question of whether it is all validly considered electors or all possible electors, such as if some states had results thrown out like what was argued in 1876. The Twelfth Amendment changed some of the rules for this but still, not the simplest system.

If a majority for one candidate doesn't happen for the Vice President then the Senate elects the VP from among the two candidates for VP with the greatest number of votes of electors, which actually did happen in 1837, and if nobody happens to have a majority for President, then only the three candidates with the most votes from the electoral college is considered down from 5 in the original Article II rules, and then the House of Representatives starts voting. The House is divided into the delegations, IE all the reps from Iowa or all of them from Michigan or Colorado or whatever, and then of those delegations, a majority must vote for one of the three candidates to win. The constitution doesn't say whether each delegation needs a plurality or majority of the reps among them to agree in order to cast that state's one vote. The constitution also doesn't say whether the House can eliminate last place at any point and hold a runoff ballot, and doesn't say whether the legislators in either House vote by secret ballot either as state delegations nor as individual reps.

Still, this actually happened back in 1825 when the House elected Adams as president over Jackson. Jackson was mad, but he didn't actually have a majority of electors nor was particularly close to having one. A good number of state legislatures have had powers similar to this before, and a few still do in certain cases where the legislature, usually in joint session, would elect the governor, either on their own or as a result of a lack of a majority for one of the candidates in the direct election.

If you happen to have a system where each state elects electors proportionally, IE candidate Y got 33% of the vote in a state with 12 electors and so gives them 4 electors, then this sort of outcome would happen in a lot of the elections in the history of the US. I did the math myself (and boy was it tedious).",1721857409,9,PoliticalDiscussion,US Elections,What do you think the politics would be like if contingent elections (elections by Congress for presidnets) were the norm?,"What do you think the politics would be like if contingent elections (elections by Congress for presidnets) were the norm?

"For third-party U.S. presidential candidates, getting on state ballots is challenging and expensive. The U.S. laws designed by Republicans and Democrats currently make this difficult to reform.

">**Voting Is An Act of Violence**  
by Hans Sherrer (1999)

>Voting is the most violent act someone can commit in their lifetime.  
This little noted anomaly about voting is directly related to the modern conception of the State as an entity deriving its grant of authority to act from the consent of the governed. The aura of legitimacy surrounding the government's actions is enhanced by the perceived role of voting as an expression of the “people's will.” Whether non-threatening or violent, the authority for each and every one of the government's actions is presumed to flow from the consent of the people through the electoral process. School children are told this from their earliest years.

>The idea the State derives its power to act from the consent of the people sounds romantic. Few people, however, are aware that by definition the State’s power is for the specific purpose of engaging in acts of violence. No grant of power is necessary for anyone, or any organization to act peacefully. This is no secret among scholars, and sociologist Max Weber's definition of the State is considered one of the most authoritative:

>“A state is a human institution that claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory. ... The state is considered the sole source of the \`right' to use violence."" 

>The legitimizing impact of voting on the government's exercise of power intimately involves voters in the use of that power. Which means that non-voters tend to delegitimize the exercise of a government's power as an expression of the “will of the people.” So if no one voted in an election or only a small percentage of people did, the government couldn't profess to be empowered to act as an agent of the “people's will.” Without the protective cover provided by voters, the government would have no pretense to act except as a law unto itself.

>Consequently, the government's actions and the voters who legitimize them are linked together. Thus at a minimum, voters are spiritually involved in every act engaged in by the government. Including all violent acts. This involvement in the government's violence isn't, tempered by the nominal peacefulness of a person’s life apart from voting. By choosing to vote a person integrates the violence engaged in by the government as a part of their life. This is just as true of people that didn't vote for a candidate who supports particular policies they may disagree with, as it is for those that did. It is going through the motion of voting that legitimizes the government to act in their name, not who or what they vote for.

>This means that the violence perpetrated by any one person pales in scope or significance when compared to that which is authorized to be taken by the government in the name of those who vote. The combined ghoulish violence of every identifiable serial killer in American history can't match the violence of even one of any number of violent actions taken by the government as the people's representative. A prominent example of this is the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf war in 1991. These sanction prevented Iraq from rebuilding its destroyed sanitation, water, and electric power infrastructure that were specifically targeted by the U. S. military for destruction. Supported and enforced by the U. S., these sanctions are credited by UNICEF and other organizations with contributing to the gruesome deaths of an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 children a month for over 8-1/2 years. All voters share in the government's contribution to the unnecessary deaths of these children caused by disease and a reduced standard of living. So the over half-a-million deaths of innocent children in Iraq in the years after 1991’s Gulf war are on the blood stained hands of every voter in the U.S.

>The same dynamic of voter involvement in government atrocities is true of the many hundreds of civilian deaths caused by the bombing of Yugoslavian cities in the spring and summer of 1999 that the United States participated in. This was a small scale recreation of the atomic bombing of the non-military cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Hundreds of thousands of innocent women, children and old people were killed from the initial bomb blasts and the long-term effects of radiation exposure. Those bombings had been preceeded by the U.S. military’s killing of many hundreds of thousands of non-combatants during the firebombings of Tokyo, Hamburg, Dresden and Berlin. All of those people were killed in the name of the voters that had elected the Roosevelt administration in 1944 by a landslide. Voting, like a missile fired at an unseen target many miles away, is a long-distance method of cleanly participating in the most horrific violence imaginable.

>So declining to vote does much more than cause a statistical entry on the non-voting side of a ledger sheet. It is a positive way for a person to lower their level of moral responsibility for acts of violence engaged in by the government that they would never engage in personally, and that they don’t want to be committed in their name as a voter. Non-voting is a positive way for a person to publicly express the depth of their private belief in respecting the sanctity of life, and that violence is only justified in self-defense.

>The social sphere in which most people live is notable for the level of peaceful cooperation that normally prevails in it. The majority of people strive to better their lives by working together with other people in the pursuit of their mutual self-interest. This community spirit of non-violent cooperation supported by non-voting, stands in sharp contrast to the societal violence endorsed by the act of voting.

I wanted to share this article and create a discussion around its arguments as I feel it is especially relevant given the current situation of this US election.

Many on the left are arguing whether it is morally acceptable to support Kamala Harris due to her lack of commitment to actions that would affect Israel's ability to inflict harm on Palestinians, they fear she would not in practice be different than Biden.

For many people the war in Gaza is a top issue when it comes to this election. As such, the ""lesser of the two evils"" argument is often brought up- as even though the enabling of violence against Palestinians is likely to continue irregardless of which candidate wins- it is believed that it would be worse under Trump, and that in general at least the violence against other groups such as trans people, women, and POC would reduced under Harris.

So, can the moral responsibility of voting for a candidate who directly or indirectly enables violence against one group of people be offset so long as that candidate is reducing the amount of violence committed against other groups? If not, what is the solution for people other than to not vote?",1722013175,0,PoliticalDiscussion,Political Theory,What is the morality of voting?

"I ask this question in part because it seems to be an unusually difficult race to get a gauge on with additional variables or factors to consider. It's quite the challenge to [Lichtman's model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_the_White_House). Important related question I'd like to include here: Can it be expected that polls near election day will underestimate the Republican candidate as it did the last 2 presidential elections, particularly in swing states? I detail some of the arguments for/against that below. Could it be as likely or more to underestimate the Democratic candidate?

The post-Biden decision polls that are out show Trump up about 1 over Harris nationally. General conventional wisdom is Harris would need to win by 2 points or more nationally, so she'd need a 3 point swing to be about even. The tipping point states are arguably the upper midwest WI/MI/PA trio, and she's down maybe an average of 2 points there, although this is based on only 2 polls this week.

[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/)

Current polling could be artificially slanted in one direction by:

1. The terrible media cycle Democrats are just coming off of.

2. The good cycle Trump has had, including the RNC convention and positive coverage from getting shot at.

3. Potential democratic voters still weighing likely nominee Harris.

4. The generally positive coverage this week for Democrats and renewed enthusiasm.

5. The scrutiny of a very questionable VP pick JD Vance, who has ties to Project 2025, ""childless cat , lady""/""miserable at their own lives"" comments resurfacing.

Which of these factors do you think are most significant? Others?

Next, how are polls likely to shift over the next few months? Some factors:

1. Democratic convention

2. Ad spending in swing states

3. Debates

4. Third party votes peeling off in one direction or the other. Which direction is likely?

5. Undecideds committing

Others?

Lastly, there are generally 2 schools of though regarding how polls are likely to be slanted. Which is more likely?

1. Poll bias (in the aggregates) has about the same chance of being biased towards Harris as Trump. Polls often underestimate Democrats - to at least a small extent in 2022, 2018 and 2012. Pollsters often adjust methodology when getting things wrong.

2. Poll aggregates will underestimate Trump support again. It happened twice. Persistent problems, like the pool of people who don't respond to polls being weighted towards Trump supporters, particularly on phone-based polls, have not been corrected. No indication any dynamics or polling methodology has changed.

Good background on 2020 on why polls missed by a few points: [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor)

If one assumes that Harris will gain some ground through the convention, she could be even or a favorite going into the fall if #1 holds. If the truth is closer to #2, she's likely still an underdog, perhaps a significant one. I guess the key questions I have here: Is there any indication pollster methodology has shifted to address the problems in 2020/2016 and have any other dynamics shifted?

The tipping point states are arguably the upper midwest WI/MI/PA trio, and she's down maybe an average of 2 points there, although this is based on only 2 polls this week.

[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/)

Current polling could be artificially slanted in one direction by:

1. The terrible media cycle Democrats are just coming off of.

2. The good cycle Trump has had, including the RNC convention and positive coverage from getting shot at.

3. Potential democratic voters still weighing likely nominee Harris.

4. The generally positive coverage this week for Democrats and renewed enthusiasm.

5. The scrutiny of a very questionable VP pick JD Vance, who has ties to Project 2025, ""childless cat , lady""/""miserable at their own lives"" comments resurfacing.

Which of these factors do you think are most significant? Others?

Next, how are polls likely to shift over the next few months? Some factors:

1. Democratic convention

2. Ad spending in swing states

3. Debates

4. Third party votes peeling off in one direction or the other. Which direction is likely?

5. Undecideds committing

Others?

Lastly, there are generally 2 schools of though regarding how polls are likely to be slanted. Which is more likely?

1. Poll bias (in the aggregates) has about the same chance of being biased towards Harris as Trump. Polls often underestimate Democrats - to at least a small extent in 2022, 2018 and 2012. Pollsters often adjust methodology when getting things wrong.

2. Poll aggregates will underestimate Trump support again. It happened twice. Persistent problems, like the pool of people who don't respond to polls being weighted towards Trump supporters, particularly on phone-based polls, have not been corrected. No indication any dynamics or polling methodology has changed.

Good background on 2020 on why polls missed by a few points: [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor)

If one assumes that Harris will gain some ground through the convention, she could be even or a favorite going into the fall if #1 holds. If the truth is closer to #2, she's likely still an underdog, perhaps a significant one. I guess the key questions I have here: Is there any indication pollster methodology has shifted to address the problems in 2020/2016 and have any other dynamics shifted?

"For those who don't know: 

Allan Lichtman's 13 Keys to the White House is a system used to predict the outcome of U.S. presidential elections. Developed by Allan Lichtman, a historian, and mathematician, the keys are a series of true/false statements that gauge the strength of the incumbent party. When six or more of these statements are false, the incumbent party is predicted to lose the White House. Here are the 13 keys:

1. **Party Mandate**: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives than it did after the previous midterm elections.
2. **Contest**: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.
3. **Incumbency**: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president.
4. **Third Party**: There is no significant third party or independent campaign.
5. **Short-Term Economy**: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign.
6. **Long-Term Economy**: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms.
7. **Policy Change**: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy.
8. **Social Unrest**: There is no sustained social unrest during the term.
9. **Scandal**: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.
10. **Foreign/Military Failure**: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.
11. **Foreign/Military Success**: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.
12. **Incumbent Charisma**: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.
13. **Challenger Charisma**: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.



In his most recent livestream from less than 24 hours ago, Lichtman says Trump holds 5 keys including 1,3,10,11, and 12; while Kamala holds the rest. 

Personally, I think key 5 goes to Trump depending on how the rest of the country feels about inflation. In other words, this election will be close. 

TLDR: Basically, he has Kamala winning so far, but this isn’t a final prediction.

This article pretty much sums up how I've always felt about him. Trump's persona has made him teflon and has carried unpopular right wing policies that would otherwise turn off voters. He is extremely energizing to partisan Republicans and he managed to almost realign Rustbelt states to the GOP in 2016 . No Republican politician seem to be able to recreate his affect or his credibility with right leaning Democrats.

If Covid had not happened, Trump might have cruised to victory in 2020 on the lack of turbulence in the economy and incumbency. 

While his persona makes him deeply repulsive to true independents, his ability to turn out his base is objectively strong, and there does not seem to be a candidate who can replicate the excitement he brings.
